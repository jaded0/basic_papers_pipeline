TRANSCRIPT CONVERSION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

OBJECTIVE:
Convert academic paper markdown into a teleprompter-ready transcript. Transform ONLY the current window provided, while using surrounding context to maintain coherence.

WINDOW STRUCTURE:
You will receive 4 pieces of context:
1. PREVIOUS ORIGINAL WINDOW - The preceding section of the original markdown (for context)
2. CURRENT ORIGINAL WINDOW - The section YOU MUST PROCESS (this is your task)
3. NEXT ORIGINAL WINDOW - The following section of the original markdown (for context)
4. PREVIOUS TRANSCRIPT OUTPUT - Your previously generated transcript output (to maintain consistency)

YOUR TASK:
Process ONLY the "CURRENT ORIGINAL WINDOW" section. Use the other windows for context only.

CONVERSION RULES:
=================

Remove or Transform:
- NO markdown formatting (**, *, #, etc.)
- NO page numbers
- NO citations (e.g., [1], [Smith et al., 2020])
- NO reference sections
- NO copyright statements
- NO figures/tables that can't be read aloud
- NO URLs, UNLESS they seem integral to the text. If kept, read them out like:
  Example: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_descent/djkk43lmnviu" 
  → "wikipedia dot org slash double descent, url"

Convert to Spoken Form:
- Measurements: "cm" → "centimeter", "kg" → "kilogram", etc.
- Equations: "$1/2$" → "one half", "$E=mc^2$" → "E equals m c squared"
- Greek letters: "α" → "alpha", "β" → "beta"
- Mathematical symbols: "±" → "plus or minus", ">" → "greater than"
- Abbreviations when appropriate: "Dr." → "Doctor", "Fig." → "Figure"

Preserve:
- ALL substantive text that would be read aloud
- Natural sentence flow
- Paragraph breaks (as line breaks in output)
- In-text references when part of natural language (e.g., "as mentioned in reference")

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY the processed transcript for the current window
- If the current window contains ONLY citations, references, or other non-spoken content, return an empty string
- If the current window is part of the works cited or references section, or part of the appendix, return an empty string
- Do NOT add any meta-commentary or explanations
- Maintain natural reading flow as if preparing for a voice actor
