Expand upon the text significantly, breaking down the section, sentence-by-sentence, in context of the whole paper. Especially equations, symbols, acronyms, specialized terminology, and important background, comprehensible by a grad student studying in an possibly unrelated field. In this case, computer science w/o much math background. Use analogies, metaphors, and examples where appropriate. Aim for clarity and depth over brevity.
- Use simple language and avoid jargon where possible.
- Explain the significance of equations and how they relate to the concepts discussed.
- Provide context for specialized terms, ensuring they are understandable to a non-expert audience.
- Maintain coherence with the overall paper while expanding on the current section.
- Review acronyms and strange terminology, but not excessively. Only expand where it aids understanding.
- Ensure the expanded text flows naturally and is engaging to read.
- Connect concepts to broader ideas, especially conclusions and implications spoken about in the paper's abstract, intro, and conclusion.

GENERAL FORMAT
- First directly quote a sentence or phrase from the original text being expanded from the currrent window.
- Then provide the expanded explanation or breakdown immediately after the quote.
- repeat for the next sentence or phrase to be expanded, skipping none. 

PRESERVE SPEAKABILITY
- NO markdown formatting (**, *, #, etc.)
- NO page numbers
- NO citations (e.g., [1], [Smith et al., 2020])
- NO reference sections
- NO copyright statements
- NO figures/tables that can't be read aloud
- NO URLs, UNLESS they seem integral to the text. If kept, read them out like:
  Example: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_descent/djkk43lmnviu" 
  → "wikipedia dot org slash double descent, url"

Convert to Spoken Form:
- Measurements: "cm" → "centimeter", "kg" → "kilogram", etc.
- Equations: "$1/2$" → "one half", "$E=mc^2$" → "E equals m c squared"
- Greek letters: "α" → "alpha", "β" → "beta"
- Mathematical symbols: "±" → "plus or minus", ">" → "greater than", "512 × 512" → "five twelve by five twelve"
- Abbreviations when appropriate: "Dr." → "Doctor", "Fig." → "Figure"

Preserve:
- ALL substantive text that would be read aloud
- Natural sentence flow
- Paragraph breaks (as line breaks in output)
- In-text references when part of natural language (e.g., "as mentioned in reference")

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY the processed expansion for the current window
- If the current window contains ONLY citations, references, or other non-spoken content, return an empty string
- If the current window is part of the works cited or references section, or part of the appendix, return an empty string
- Maintain natural reading flow as if preparing for a voice actor

CONCISENESS:
- Take into account explanations already provided in previous windows to avoid redundancy, but do not hesitate to re-explain crucial concepts for clarity.
- Any repeating explanations are justifiable if complex or crucial to the main ideas of the paper.
- Conceptually simple phrases or sentences can be left unexpanded, lumped into the quotation along with more complex parts and left unaddressed in the expansion.
- If an explanation for multiple sentences is highly interconnected, feel free to quote them together and provide a single, cohesive expansion. Atomic, brief comments are preferred where sufficient, however, for understanding by a CS grad student.
